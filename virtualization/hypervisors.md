# Hypervisor

Today, this is not anymore true and there are different type of hypervisors architectures. The first one is Type-1 or Bare Metal, an architecture where the hypervisor itself talks to the underling hardware. The most widely used Type-1 hypervisors are:

- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Xen
- VMWare EXi

The second architecture is Type-2, where the hypervisor is an application which talks to the hardware via an operative system. Major hypervisors using this architecture are:
